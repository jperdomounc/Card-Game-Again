31/Blitz Game (Again) (add read me styling later)
Did in this in Python a while back, but screwed myself over by using chatgpt
Doing this again, but banning myself from even smelling ai

Writing this README by hand in the spirit of anti-ai when it comes to learning programming (Please don't hurt me ,Singularity. I think ai is really cool actually.)
I came to the revelation that this is kind of the perfect coding project for me at my skill level.
So basically I just want to implement the game in the terminal with some 'bots' to play against me.
With future plans to have this be multiplayer. Saw some stuff about p2p networking or just like being a server and hosting other people and communicating over like tcp or something.~
